# MÃ˜TRT QSO Map Tool

A utility for amateur radio operators, to show the contents of their log visually on a map. This is what I use to generate maps for my blog posts about portable radio operations.

This was originally intended to be a replacement of sorts for the tool that used to live at [http://qsomap.adventureradio.de/](http://qsomap.adventureradio.de/), sadly now offline. I have since added more features; it also does all the processing client-side rather than using a database and processing on the back end.

Use it at [https://qsomap.m0trt.radio](https://qsomap.m0trt.radio).

* Popup balloons showing your QSO history
* Filter by date, band and mode
* Grid/location lookups from POTA, SOTA, WWBOTA, WWFF, GMA & QRZ.com

For upcoming features, see the [issues backlog](https://github.com/ianrenton/qsomap/issues). If you'd like an extra feature, please let me know!

### Privacy

All the code for the QSO map runs locally in your browser, so your log file "uploads" don't leave your computer. If you enter your QRZ.com username and password to use the lookup service, the credentials are sent to QRZ.com via HTTPS, which encrypts them in transit. The callsigns of your QSO partners are also sent. The POTA, SOTA etc. APIs may also be queried for the grid square of any references in your logs; this does not include your QSO partners' callsigns.

The website itself does not use cookies, is not monetised, does not contain advertising, and does not receive or store any user data. It is open source and the code is released into the Public Domain.
