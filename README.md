# ADIF Map Tool

A utility to amateur radio operators, to show the contents of an ADIF file visually on a map. This is what I use to generate maps of my contacts for my blog posts about portable radio operations.

Use it at [https://adifmap.m0trt.radio](https://adifmap.m0trt.radio).

### Features

* Configurable base maps
* Configurable icons, including POTA/SOTA/etc. symbols

### Coming soon

This was originally intended to be a replacement of sorts for the tool that used to live at [http://qsomap.adventureradio.de/](http://qsomap.adventureradio.de/), sadly now offline.

The following features are coming soon to reach feature parity:

* Filtering options
* More icon options
* Error handling
* Grid lookups from QRZ.com etc

### Notes

Includes a copy of [savy.js](https://github.com/medabida/savy), used with thanks.
